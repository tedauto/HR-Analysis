# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze employee attrition data to identify key factors that contribute to employee turnover. By understanding the underlying causes of attrition, organizations can develop strategies to improve employee retention and reduce the associated costs.

## Data Sources

The attrition dataset for this project was provided by **MeriSKILL**.

## Tools and Technologies

The project utilizes various tools and technologies for data analysis including:

* Python programming language
* Pandas data analysis library
* NumPy numerical computing library
* Matplotlib and Seaborn data visualization libraries
* Tableau
* Jupyter notebook

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis by handling missing values and duplicates present in the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I explored the data to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and uncover potential insights. I performed both univaraite and multivariate analysis.

3. **Results and Analysis:**
   
     From the **EDA** it was noted that most of the numerical variables were skewed to the right. Such as:
     * **Monthly income** for most employees was **less than 5000**.
     * Most of the employees **working years** were **less than 10 years**.
     * Majority of the employees had only been to **1** company.
       
    **Job satisfacation** rating was at **3.0** meaning most of the employees were **satisfied** with their jobs.

 ## Key insights 
 
* Employee attrition rate was **significantly higher** at **16.12%**.
* Some of the **factors** that impacted the attrition was Age, Gender, Department, Education Field and Level of education, Job satisfaction rating.
* There was a **significantly higher** number of **Male** employees **leaving** the company compared to **Female** employees.
* Employees working in **technical and executive** roles recorded an **high** job satisfaction rating.
* In addition employees in **technical departments such as research and development** were likely to leave and that corresponds to the **education fields** such as **life science** and **medicine**.
* Employees in their **30s** were **very likely** to leave the company.
* Employees who had **bachelors degree** were **likely** to leave the company.
